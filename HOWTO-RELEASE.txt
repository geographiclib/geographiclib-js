This branch just support version 1.52.2, the last pre-2.0.0 release of
geographiclib.  Minimal cmake support for the top-level and doc
directories has been added.

Screwed up with verion 1.52.1 (flakey cmake files didn't update
README.md in BUILD directory -- not worth fixing).  So

  npm deprecate -f geographiclib@1.52.1 "Documentation inconsistent"

and release 1.52.2

Version update

# JavaScript
#   js/src/Math.js
#   js/package.json
#   js/README.md
#   js/GeographicLib.md (date + update change log)
# use: cd js; jshint src

cmake -B BUILD-old
cd BUILD-old
make
